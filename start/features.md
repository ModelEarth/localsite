## Integration between Websites

JavaScript for sharing sustainability projects between websites.  

**hashChangeEvent** - triggers independent widgets when the URL hash is changed both programmatically and by the user.    

goHash({"go":"bioeconomy"}); - Hash change triggers widgets.  

updateHash({"go":"bioeconomy"}); - Only hash updated.  

**param** - An object containing key-values from three sources: the current URL hash, parameters in the URL, and parameters set on the javascript include&nbsp;file.  

**loadMarkdown** - Pulls readme files into html and converts links and image tags based on folder levels.  

**lazy class** - Sometimes it's good to be lazy. This class waits to load images until just before they scroll into view.
