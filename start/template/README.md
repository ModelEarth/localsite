## How to add a new localsite readme page

Add a folder in an existing repo or create a new repo in your [Github Account](https://github.com).

1. Copy the current [index.html page from GitHub](https://github.com/ModelEarth/localsite/blob/main/start/index.html) or use View Page Source. Another option is to just copy the localsite.js tag.
2. Add text to a README.md file adjacent to the copied index.html file.  (Always capitalize README and lowercase .md)
3. Fork the [localsite repo](https://github.com/ModelEarth/localsite) and turn on GitHub Pages for localsite and your repo to view at https://[your account].github.io/[your repo].

<!--
3. Optionally, [add Localsite parameters](../../) for locations (state and counties) and impact sets (air, water, land, energy, health, prosperity) to embed maps and visualizations [for local communities](/io/) and [international goals](/data-commons/docs).
