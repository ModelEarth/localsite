# Dive Into Data Commons

Join us to create new tools and industry maps for Sustainable Material Management (SMM) that integrate with [Google Data Commons](https://datacommons.org).

Get started with our [Data Commons Lite setup steps](/localsite/info/data/datacommons/#setup) 

We're exploring infusing Google Data Commons with US EPA indicators. 

See additional details in the Google Data Commons section of our [project list](../../../../community/projects/#google).

Areas of focus include:  

- <a href="../../../localsite/info/#showloc">Industries and Impacts by county</a> - great to also include by zip! 
- [Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS)](https://www.bls.gov/data/)  
- [Solar Companies](../../localsite/map/#show=solar)   
- [Electric Vehicle Ecosystems](../../localsite/info/#state=GA&show=vehicles)  
- [Commute Times and Walkability](../)

<b>EV Challenge Statements</b>  

1. Where are concentrations of electric and hydrogen vehicle parts manufacturers emerging?  

2. Where are combustion vehicle manufacturers likely to be impacted?  

3. How can we improve the visualization of supply chain inflow and outflow for local impacts on jobs, value added and the environment?
