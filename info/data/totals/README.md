# Samples of Merging Input-Output Data for Totals

These samples no longer work following changes by Leo or Micheal.  

1. [New Commodity Chart](https://model.earth/useeio.js/test/example_tabulator.html) ([Github](https://github.com/USEPA/useeio.js/blob/dev/test/example_tabulator.html)) - Two JSON files are combined in Javascript and displayed with Tabulator. Javascript multiplies the total commodity output `q` and the `jobs` indicator values per 1 USD output from&nbsp;[matrix&nbsp;`D`](../../../io/about/matrix/) - Update to show matrix D data grid.

2. View the same chart in a [React page with Tabulator](https://github.com/TheTisiboth/useeio-widgets/tree/IoChartTabulator) - The url of the page is localhost/ jobsTable.html  

Compare Tabulator with Material UI datagrid [Sector List](../../../io/charts) widgets which also handle the sorting. 

Create a similar chart display using Material UI within the [USEEIO-widgets repo](https://github.com/USEPA/useeio-widgets/).
