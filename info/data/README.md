# Data Pipeline

To prepare data for our [industry impact page](https://model.earth/localsite/info/), we're using [GitHub Actions](/community/projects/#github-actions) and two processes that estimate gaps in BLS data: Ecker Linear Objective Functions and Taylor Machine Learning.  

We process NAICS industry data into [state files with county employment levels](https://github.com/modelearth/community-data/tree/master/us/state) which are loaded client-side to filter [US EPA Input-Output Charts](../../../io/charts/) which use [static JSON USEEIO impact data](https://github.com/modelearth/io/tree/main/build/api).  

**Our NAICS pipeline**
1. [Generate state county files](https://github.com/modelearth/community-data) for 2 to 6 digit NAICS industries for static hosting on Github.  
To avoid gaps in county industry data, we'll use this [2018 data from Ecker](https://github.com/modelearth/community-data/tree/master/process/cbp).  
3. Compare with output from our [Machine Learning script](https://github.com/modelearth/machine-learning) created by John Taylor.  
4. Our [comparison report](../../info/naics/) will be a new version of our [EPA Local Industries Impact Report](../../info/).

[Embeddable IO Widgets](../../charts) use the [static JSON files](https://github.com/modelearth/io/tree/main/build/api) output from the [USEEIO API](https://github.com/USEPA/USEEIO_API/wiki).
We recommend that you work in [USEEIO-widgets repo](../../charts) if you are interested in interacting with the API data.

## NAICS Data with Fewer Gaps

[Imputed County Business Patterns (CBP) dataset](http://www.fpeckert.me/cbp/) by [Fabian Ecker, et al.](http://fpeckert.me/cbp/efsy.pdf) - The Fabian Ecker (2021) work extends Isserman and Westervelt (2006), but uses a linear objective function for faster computation with exact results. The authors are planning to apply to zip codes. "After 1994, the CBP files contain tabulations at the zip code level. We plan to apply our imputation method to this geographic unit in a future draft." - [2018 data from Ecker](https://github.com/modelearth/community-data/tree/master/process/cbp).     

## Community Data File Format

Our NAICS county CSV files have the following columns - [Sample File](https://github.com/modelearth/community-data/blob/master/us/state/GA/naics/GA_data_filled.csv)  

- FIPS - Location (5-digit state-county ID)  
- NAICS - ActivityProducedBy (6-digit naics)  
- Establishments - Other (Number of Extablishments)  
- Employees - Employment FlowAmount (Number of Employees)  
- Payroll - US Dollars (Annual Wages)
- Population - Included with our Machine Learning output


## Using Machine Learning to Fill Gaps

When a county's 6-digit industry naics is missing employee and payroll data, its parent categories (5, 4, 3 or 2-digit naics) will also omit the data. This occurs when there are only a couple firms in a county to protect the privacy of individual firms. (We've seen 15+ establishments with no data.)

A very rough estimate for local industry employee counts and payroll can be generated by averaging values from other counties in the state, however some states have over 80 of 380+ industries without any employee and payroll data.

We might use our [Machine Learning scripts](https://github.com/modelearth/machine-learning) to complement the [Ecker data](https://github.com/modelearth/community-data/tree/master/process/cbp) with payroll estimates.
